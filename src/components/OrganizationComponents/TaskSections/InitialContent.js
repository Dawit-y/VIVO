    <p>
        For the next step in the acquisition process, we need to project some forward-looking financials to estimate revenues and expenses, and gain a better understanding of what financial performance might look like over a future time period. This will help facilitate a healthy discussion with both our client and the target when it comes time to discuss valuation, or determining how much to pay for the asset.
        As such, we'd like you to build a simple five-year forecast so we can better evaluate the asset. An associate has emailed you some basic assumptions as well as a template model for you to run the numbers.
        Let’s touch base once you are finished to review outputs.

    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>We need you to create a high-level set of projections for the target company. As time is of the essence, I’ve attached a simple income statement (IS) model template from a former deal that you can use to draft your forecast. For the projected period, please use the following key operating assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Forecast period: 5 years</li>
        <li>YoY Revenue Growth: 10%</li>
        <li>COGS % Revenue: assume declining margin to 76%</li>
        <li>SG&A % Revenue: assume declining margin to 16%</li>
        <li>Depreciation: $800 million for 2022 and held constant at 1.5% margin as % revenue</li>
        <li>Amortization: $100 million for 2022 and held constant over projection period</li>
        <li>Interest exp: $25 million for 2022 and held constant over projection period</li>
        <li>Tax rate: 20%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, please develop a five-year financial projection forecast model using the above key operating assumptions and information from the target company’s “FY22 Annual Report” as source inputs.</p>
    <p>As a tip, the provided assumptions will drive your model outputs in the projected period by properly linking cells and using consistent formulas that flow and should always be presented from left to right. Once you’ve finished your forecast model, submit the Excel document below.</p>
